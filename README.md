# ggplot-class

Some content for a short, informal class on ggplot2 (May 2024).

`exercises.R` is the realisation of a few of the class exercises.

`script-ggplot.R` generates a collection of examples for the slides and for discussion.

`lec-ggplot.tex` is LaTeX (Beamer) code for the slides. Many figure dependencies aren't included in this repo (although the attributions should be enough to locate them). The R code generates the figures used to illustrate specific technical points. The text is really for reference only. `header.tex` contains style dependencies.
